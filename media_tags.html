    <h3>Taj Mahal, Agra</h3>
    <p>The Taj Mahal 'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in
        the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house
        the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the
        centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal
        gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

        Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the
        project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653
        at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion
        (about U.S. $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of
        architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. Various types of symbolism have been
        employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.</p>
    <h4>History of Taj Mahal</h4>
    <p>In the sixteenth century, the tomb was built by a Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (son of Mughal Emperor Jahangir), for
        his wife as a tribute to her after her demise. Shah Jahan, at the age of 14, married a Persian princess, Mumtaz
        Mahal. He had many wives but was intensely in love with Mumtaz and she too returned the same. Mumtaz was known
        for her mesmerizing beauty and grace. In 1632, unfortunately, after giving birth to their 14th child, a baby
        girl, (who was later named as Jahanara) Mumtaz Mahal passed away.

        The last wish to Shah Jahan was, he would not marry again and would build a palace (Mahal) as an essence of
        their infinite love. It was the same year when Shah Jahan started building the monument for his beloved wife.

    <h3>India Gate, Delhi</h3>
    <p>India Gate that in fact lies around the ceremonial avenue of Raj path is an Important and significant Memorial
        Site completed in February of 1921 and forms the landmark of Delhi also known as the gate of the eight city of
        Delhi named ‘New Delhi’ which was carved out of the beautifully architected Old City of Delhi created by the
        Mughal Emperors in the ancient times. It lies in the heart of the new city flanked by roads on all directions
        and is easily accessible by local taxis, buses and auto rickshaws from any corner of Delhi due to its central
        location.

        This City of New Delhi is probably one of the well planned cities designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker
        around the likes of the British rulers with India Gate and the surrounding areas of Raj path forming the main
        plan of central Delhi including the Rashtrapati Bhavan formerly known as the Viceroy’s Palace commanding a
        panoramic view of the city. The view stretches from Raisina Hills running seamlessly across India Gate and Raj
        path but is hindered only by the National Stadium of Delhi.</p>
    <h4>History of India Gate</h4>
    <p>Commissioned as part of the Imperial War Graves Commission to remember the 70,000 soldiers from the British
        Indian Army who lost their lives during the First World War, the foundation stone for the memorial was laid in
        February 1921, by the visiting Duke of Connaught.

        Designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had worked extensively both in New Delhi and on war memorials
        in Europe, it has been described by some as a reworking of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It is 138 foot tall and
        38 meet wide, built on a base of red Bharatpur stone.

        In 1931, the memorial was inaugurated by Lord Irwin, and remains an important focal point in the city today. It
        is often used as a focal point for contemporary protests, and several have started at the India Gate in recent
        years.</p>
